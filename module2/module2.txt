Module 2

1)Take the CSV file

	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Asho4m7yuEgEvqvzuPGq8q_YH8aLoGClYHhDjV83h2I/edit?usp=sharing

	Read the CSV file
	Provide mean of CPU Util, RAM Util  for the whole period. Result should be in JSON format
	Find the times when CPU Util and RAM Util are highest. Result should be in JSON array  consisting of following tuple <CPU Util, Time, Value> , <RAM Util, Time, Value>

2)Write a Python program to create a Caesar encryption
	Note : In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

3)Remove leading zeros from IP address e.g. print(remove_zeros_from_ip("255.024.01.01"))

4)Write a Python program to find common items from two lists

5)Normalization of URLs
	Read file 
	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KXP80gMZTqABJEc2a81z17HrV_CqMdEmrUNXa9tIY7k/edit?usp=sharing


	If you see 2 URLs  post http://www.myApp/1/save and 
	http://www.myApp/2/save ,
	they should be replaced by http://www.myApp/*/save 
	Get a list of normalized patterns of URLs

6)job status
	Read file https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UqIOAJBb8vJhLv_kfT3VOz1O8PcNflbUSZ8xqZCrEc/edit?usp=sharing

	Each row contains - jobId, status, time
	When a job 1 starts, an entry is present in the table  (1, started, time)
	When a job completes, an entry is again made in table (1, completed, time)
	Parse the whole file and create a new csv file with entries (jonId, startTime, endTime, duration, status)
	If a job is not ended , then the end-time and duration will be empty and status is “in progress”
	Store the results in Module2_4.csv

7)Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary.

8)Iterate through a dictionary
	Read Module2_4.csv file
	Store the data in a dictionary where the key is JobId
	Get JobId from console and print the details of the Job

9)Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys. 
	d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300}
	d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd':400}
	Sample output: Counter({'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'd': 400, 'c': 300})

10)Perform Matrix multiplication
