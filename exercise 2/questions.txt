1. Read yaml file and write into json file sample files are provided with the mail sample1.yaml
2. For the same above code write exception handing so that the code should handle wrong file and print it, sample2.yaml having wrong yaml format
3. create a base class on one file of folder 'a' file named 'shapes' and a method to find area, 
       create another file on another folder named 'b' and create 3 classes for rectangle, square and triangle
	   inheritting class shapes and those should contain methods to find circumstance and perimeter,
       find area, circumstance and perimeter of rectangle, square, triangle
4. Create tic tac toe game using python classes, also use docstrings, anotations, comment, this code should be neat with following pip standards,(note: this might take time, let me know once completed.)
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pep-8-coding-style-guide-python/            to check the common standards followed
	pylint sample.py          to check score of the python file sample.py and pep issues it found. Try to increase score as much as possible.
	Note: 	use list of list to store the possition and get input based on that possition
		ex:  at start it should show      
				[1, 2, 3]
				[4, 5, 6]
				[7, 8, 9]
			
			should print each time input is taken
				[O, 2, 3]
				[4, 5, X]
				[7, 8, 9]
